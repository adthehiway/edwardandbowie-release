    synopsis: "Socialites, models and pop stars made up the stream of humanity that flowed through Edward Bell's Earl's Court basement studio in 1981, the year Marcus Thompson shot the original cinema short entitled 'Edward'. Part fantasy and part reality, the thirty-minute film examined Bell's methods, influences, lifestyle and work and was shot on 35mm in London and the South of France. Now a new film has just been completed.",

Part fantasy and part reality, the thirty-minute film examined Bell's methods, influences, lifestyle and work and was shot on 35mm in London and the South of France. Now a new film has just been completed.\n\nThompson found the 35mm negative to the original film in the BFI Archives. The idea was to revisit the artist's world over four decades later, as he looks back at the chronic, the creative, the static and chaotic – his heroin addiction, his close friendship with David Bowie, and a lingering love. Is this film set in the early 1980s, but haunted by the future? Or is it set in the present, and haunted by the past? In Edward's own words, 'In the early eighties I was a fully fledged junkie and contributed nothing creative to your filming; I wish to right that wrong. Let's put it on a different level, with more depth and stretch the time-scale, then and now.'",
